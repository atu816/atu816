# ü§ù Nice to meet you!
My name is Alexander and I am a software engineer who values finding creative solutions to everyday problems. As a music enthusiast, I believe there is an intersection between the arts and technology that is key towards fostering an organic relationship between companies and consumers. It is in my goals as a developer to continue exploring that space in order to help progress the world.

## üîß Technologies:
I enjoy creating applications through full-stack development but especially love working with React/Redux/Node in particular.

Here are some other technologies that you can find in my work.
